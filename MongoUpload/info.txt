On branch master Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. 
Changes not staged for commit: modified: helpdesk/libs/footer.php 
no changes added to commit 



git commit -a
instead of just
git commit

git commit -a -m "Fix compilation"
git push origin master


add the -a or --all flag to the end of the command. 
that will tell git to to check for changed files and any with changes should be comitted.

one of the best in the market. To publish an app, you will need to pay Android $25, or Apple $99 for a developer’s license.



or example, it found that the highest revenue generators are in social network and communications apps, such as Skype or WhatsApp, which garner about 20% more app-month revenue than the next best category: medical and fitness apps. Coming in third are apps related to location and location-based services (LBS), such as mapping and navigation.


y. iOS has the lowest percentage of developers (42%) below the “app poverty li

. Based on figures of 50% for half of developers, iOS developers, on average, generate 37% more revenue per app-month than Android developers. “


Among those “wishing to make money,” the Vision Mobile study found that 17% “actually make no money at all on mobile Web development, a higher percentage than any other platform. At the same time, mobile Web developers in the $5,000 to $100,000 range pocket 91% of mobile Web of app-month revenues.”

 While IT services and games garners about $1,500 per app in monthly revenue
pps for banking/finance or real estate generate over $5,000 per app per month.



ome 29% of developers were not sure how much money they made. Among those that knew their income, an app has a 35% chance of generating under $500. “


Additionally, 25% of all developers generally don’t earn any revenue.
Among those that do, 
14% will make between $500 and $1,000 per app, 
while 13% will generate revenues somewhere between $1,001 and 45,000 per app, per month.
The survey also found that less than 7% will make more than $10,000 per app per month.


A separate but related survey from research firm Canalys (PDF press release) 
found that the majority of revenue at the leading app stores – Apple’s App Store (iPhone only) 
and Google Play – is generated by a small number of developers who come from mostly gaming companies, 
according to a company release. 

Just 25 developers accounted for 50% of app revenue in the U.S. in both stores 
for the first 20 days of November 2012, according to Canalys, 
which based its figures on daily App Interrogator surveys. 

With the exception of Pandora with its Pandora Radio app, 
the rest of the top grossing developers are game developers from the likes of Zynga, 
Electronic Arts, Disney, Kabam, Rovio, Glue Gameloft, and Storm8’s TeamLava.


This notion seems to be backed up by data. 
According to App Annie, India already takes third place in all app downloads for Google Play, 
but it is nowhere to be found in the corresponding revenue chart. 

The same story for Brazil and Russia — lots of downloads, 
but almost no revenue for developers.

 It sure seems that users in these countries either can’t afford 
or just do not want to pay for app content the same way 
that users in the US and Western Europe do.

Hi Charles,
You don't need to include bsonobjbuilder.h nor dbclientcursor.h.  These files are included within dbclient.h already.  Your test almost compiles if I take out those two include lines (DBClientConnection.query returns a std::auto_ptr for me, not a boost::shared_ptr).
-Eric

The 'verify' function is a macro defined in src/mongo/client/redef_macros.h:

#pragma push_macro("verify")
#undef verify
#define verify MONGO_verify


src/mongo/client/redef_macros.h:83: warning: ignoring #pragma push_macro
